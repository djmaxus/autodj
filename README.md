## Roadmap

- [ ] Basic dual math
- [ ] Interface prototype
- [ ] Single argument differentiation
- [ ] Documentation / tests
- [ ] pre-alpha publication describing upcoming functionality
- [ ] Crate tuning (privacy, automation, versioning)
- [ ] Static dual vectors
- [ ] Extension examples for not implemented functions
- [ ] Dynamic dual vectors
- [ ] `num` / `num-traits` support
